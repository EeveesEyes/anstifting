## Welcome to Anstiftung

Anstiftung is a collection of our past pen and paper adventures and settings in German, which should serve as inspiration for everyone to create their own adventures. 
In the future we will add more adventures and translate them into English if possible.

Upcoming adventures will take place in various settings like:

- France in 1950s
- the artus legend, but with magic
- a custom cyberpunk world
- the Orient Express in 1909
